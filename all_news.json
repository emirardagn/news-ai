        "sum": "A new study from Anglia Ruskin University reveals a growing demand on the dark web for AI-generated child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Researchers analyzed online forums and discovered that individuals are actively seeking information and guidance on creating AI-generated CSAM. \n\nThe study highlights that forum members are sharing tutorials, videos, and advice on using AI to produce this harmful content. Some participants even refer to those creating AI imagery as \"artists.\"  While some express hope for future technological advancements to simplify the process, many are already using existing images of children to manipulate and generate CSAM. \n\nThe researchers emphasize that the misconception surrounding AI-generated images as \"victimless\" is dangerous. They stress that these images still exploit real children and contribute to the normalization of child abuse.  The study calls for further investigation into the methods used to create AI-CSAM, its distribution patterns, and the impact it has on offenders' behavior. \n\n\n"

        "sum": "Imperial College London has received a donation from AMD to support research into more efficient AI hardware and software. The donation recognizes the work of Professor George Constantinides and Dr Aaron Zhao in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering.  The funding will be used to improve the performance and energy consumption of large language models (LLMs), similar to ChatGPT.\n\nThe research focuses on reconfigurable processors known as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). FPGAs allow programmers to reconfigure sets of logic gates, enabling them to experiment with new processor designs before manufacturing fixed-function integrated circuits. The researchers aim to explore how to configure FPGAs for high-performing LLMs.\n\nA key aspect of the research is finding the optimal design of arithmetic units in processors, which carry out computations over numbers represented using bits.  The team has discovered that machine learning models can tolerate a lower level of precision in number representation, making it possible to optimize for speed and energy efficiency. The research also involves optimizing the design of machine learning models themselves to work effectively on these reconfigurable processors. \n\n\nThis research could lead to the development of more efficient AI hardware for applications like laptops, cloud assistants, and embedded systems in cars and robots. It could also inform the design of future application-specific processors designed specifically for machine learning.\n"

        "sum": "The Tokyo metropolitan government has implemented an AI-powered system utilizing high-altitude cameras to swiftly detect fires and building collapses during earthquakes. This initiative aims to accelerate disaster response in anticipation of a potential megaquake along the Nankai Trough, which experts warn poses a significant risk to Japan. \n\nThe AI analyzes footage from strategically positioned cameras, identifying smoke or structural damage and transmitting this information to relevant agencies such as police, fire departments, and the Japan Self-Defense Forces. This system enhances response time compared to manual camera operation previously employed.\n\nCurrently operational since March, the system encompasses cameras at the Tokyo metropolitan government building, a bridge near Tokyo Bay, and a western location. By the end of fiscal year 2025, two additional cameras will be installed at Tokyo Skytree, expanding coverage to nearly all of Tokyo's wards.  The AI also detects areas densely populated with wooden houses, allowing authorities to prioritize high-risk zones. This technological advancement underscores Tokyo's commitment to mitigating potential devastation from a major earthquake. \n\n\n"

        "sum": "Donald Trump falsely claimed that a crowd gathered to see Vice President Kamala Harris speak in Michigan last week \"didn't exist\" and that an image showing it was AI-generated.  \n\nMultiple images and videos from various sources, including news agencies, TV news teams, and attendees, show a large crowd present at the Democratic presidential nominee's rally in Detroit. Local media estimated around 15,000 people attended the event held at Detroit Metropolitan Airport. The Harris campaign confirmed that the photo in question was taken by their staff on an iPhone 12 Pro Max device on August 7th and has not been modified using AI.  \n\nTrump's claim stemmed from a photo posted on X by a Harris campaign staffer, which showed a large crowd gathered behind the stage where Harris spoke. Some online users suggested elements of the photo were manipulated using AI, such as the absence of a reflection in a plane's side and the lack of an identification number on the tail. However, other photographs taken at the event show similar reflections and the missing identification number is also visible in footage from other events featuring Air Force Two. Prof Hany Farid, an image analysis specialist, analyzed the photo using software designed to detect AI-generated images and found no evidence of manipulation. \n\n\n"
